I've included a class called .background-image that is how you can perfectly fill a 
webpage with a background image.
(It's a pain in the butt to google this. I included the best link I found in the solution.)

Then on your HTML file, create a div that wraps your entire content on the landing page
 and give it this class.

Example:
<div class="background-image">
   <div class="container">
      <!-- More html here -->
   </div>
</div>
*/
/* .background-image {
   /* https://css-tricks.com/perfect-full-page-background-image/
   background: url("../images/background-landing.jpg") no-repeat center center
      fixed;
   background-size: cover;
   min-height: 100vh;
}
*/

.btn-link {
   font-weight: $font-weight-bold;
   padding: 0;
   border: none;
}
.btn-group .btn {
   font-weight: $font-weight-normal;
}
